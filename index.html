              <li>
                <strong>Easy AI (Random)</strong><br />
                Uses purely random attacks without any strategy. Simply picks
                spots randomly on the board, regardless of previous hits or
                misses.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Normal AI (Adjacent)</strong><br />
                Starts with random attacks. After scoring a hit, it enters
                "adjacent mode," focusing subsequent attacks on neighboring
                cells to find the rest of the ship.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hard AI (Checkerboard)</strong><br />
                Attacks in a checkerboard pattern, ensuring no ship can hide in
                the gaps. Once it hits a ship, it switches to adjacent targeting
                for more precise attacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Extreme AI (Probability Map)</strong><br />
                Creates a probability map of likely ship locations based on
                remaining ships, previous hits, and possible ship placements.
                Attacks the highest probability spots, making it the most
                strategic AI.

              <li>
                The <strong>"Probability Map"</strong> and
                <strong>"Target"</strong> toggles appear during a game with
                Extreme AI. They are used to
                <strong>visually show how the AI thinks.</strong>

              <li>
                <strong>Probability Map Toggle</strong><br />
                This visually displays a
                <strong>heatmap of the probability values</strong> in the
                gameboard. The brighter the cell, the more likely a ship is
                occupying it. The darker the cell, the less likely a ship is
                present.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Targets Toggle</strong><br />
                This visually displays the cells that the AI
                <strong>plans to attack</strong> on the next moves. These cells
                have the highest values on the probability map, and therefore
                have the highest likelihood a ship may occupy it.

          <h3 class="about-title">> How the Extreme AI works</h3>
          <div class="about-content">
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Extreme AI targeting in this Battleship game uses a
                <strong>probability map</strong> to make informed decisions.
                This is how it works:
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Reset Probability Map</strong><br />
                Create a "probabilty" property for each cell. Then, set the
                probability of all cells on the board to zero.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Update Probability Map</strong><br />When updating the
                probability map, the AI uses two techniques to maximize its
                chances to destroy a ship.
                <ul>
                  <li class="second-li">
                    <strong>Default Mode</strong><br />
                    This mode is triggered by default. The AI finds *every
                    possible* spot a ship could have been placed on. For each
                    remaining ship length, it considers both horizontal and
                    vertical placements across the entire board. If a ship can
                    legally fit (without overlapping known hits or extending off
                    the board), the AI increments the probability value for all
                    cells that ship would have occupied. This creates a heat map
                    of likely ship locations based on the current game state.
                  </li>

                  <li class="second-li">
                    <strong>Adjacent Mode</strong><br />This mode is triggered
                    when the AI identifies a hit on a ship that hasn't been
                    sunk. In this mode, the AI prioritizes targeting cells
                    adjacent to the known hits to maximize the chances of
                    completing the sinking of the ship. The AI evaluates both
                    horizontal and vertical placements around the hit cells,
                    updating a probability map to reflect higher probabilities
                    for these adjacent cells. This focused approach allows the
                    AI to efficiently target and sink ships by concentrating
                    attacks around already damaged areas, increasing the
                    likelihood of successful hits.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Select Highest Probability</strong><br />
                The AI scans the entire probability map and selects the cell
                with the highest probability as its target. If multiple cells
                tie for the highest probability, it randomly chooses among them.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Repeat the Process</strong><br />
                The AI repeats these steps until all ships have been destroyed.
                By following this approach, the AI can make smart, educated
                guesses about the locations that may most likely have a ship.
